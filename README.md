Slideshow Recipe
======================

This module is a simple config recipe developed to help illustrated what can
be done with a module that only contains config files and CSS. 


This recipe creates

 - A Slideshow content type
 - A view using Flexslider and Flexslider Views module to display Slideshows. For the slideshow images also added an image style.
 - A Flexslider configuration file for this slideshow.

 While some users may be happy with the configuration of this Slideshow feature 
 exactly as defined in the recipe. We expect that most users will use 
 this recipe as a starting point and customize it to meet their unique needs.
